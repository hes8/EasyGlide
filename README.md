                         Easy Glide Into Linux

This is a "Learn By Doing" tutorial which gets a learner started with
only the basic Linux commands. It combines voice clips, examples,
exercises and explanations. This repository doesn't include the .mp3
voice clips (because of their size), but does have a document with text
for each of the voice clips - which can be used in place of the .mp3s or
you can record them yourself.

The only command used which is missing from some Linux distributions,
is the  tree   command, and it can easily be loaded into the Linux
system set up for the learner - as described in the get-set-up.html
page.

All the files are intended to be in one directory, and the main page is
the index.html page
