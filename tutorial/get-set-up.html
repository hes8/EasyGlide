A Linux image named <b>Glide</b> has been set up in the VCL (which is
the same thing as the VCE) which already has a number of directories and
files set up which make for an easy start. (If you don't have access to
the VCL, or the VCL image, <a href="glide-image.html"> here's how to set
up the equivalent environment.</a>)<p>

You will need to have or make a "Reservation" and then to login to that 
remote Linux computer through the VCL
<a href="https://vcl.ncsu.edu/get-help/documentation/how-do-i-get-started/"
target="_blank">Click here for a full description.</a> 
Remember that if you mess up something,
for a fresh start you can just delete your VCL Reservation and make a 
new one.

height="125" width="175"><br>Choose Glide if it's showing, or use the
drop-down menu to select it.</td></tr></table><p>

You've made a Reservation for Glide, and when the "Connect" button
shows up, click on it and a pop-up window such as:
<pre>
Connect to reservation using SSH (Secure Shell) 

If you did not click on the Connect! button from the computer you will be 
using to access the VCL system, you will need to return to the Current 
Reservations page and click the Connect! button from a web browser 
running on the same computer from which you will be connecting to the 
VCL system. Otherwise, you may be denied access to the remote computer.

Use the following information when you are ready to connect:

    Remote Computer: 152.46.18.165 <font color=red> <b>Note: use your reservation's IP address, not this one</b></font>
    User ID: (your-user-id)
    Password: (use your campus password)
</pre>

will give the IP address of the Remote Computer - think of it as the
name of the remote computer. Of course you use the IP address in your
pop-up window, not the one in this example.<p>

Next we need to have a terminal/command window from the remote computer
show up on your screen. How this is done depends on the operating system
of your local computer and the software installed on your local
computer.

<table><tr><td>
<center><b><font color=red>Mac</font></b></center>
The needed software is already installed. Use Finder -> Applications ->
Utilities and double click on Terminal. Or just type terminal in the
Finder. In that window you type &nbsp; &nbsp; ssh id@IP-address &nbsp;
&nbsp; where "id" is your ID, and then enter your password when requested.

</td>
<td>
<center><b><font color=green>Windows</font></b></center>
Perhaps the easiest way is to 
<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">
download and install the PuTTY software.</a>
Start PuTTY, enter the IP address in the box for that, and that will
bring up a window where you enter your ID and then enter your password
when requested.<p>
(Another Windows method is to use Remote Desktop
Connection app. But this requires the remote Linux computer to have
some special software installed and so won't work in many (most?) cases.
That's why it's not used here.)
</td></tr></table><p>

<table><tr><td>
At this point you're logged into the remote Linux computer in the VCL.
(The top line in the window shows your ssh login command, using your ID
and the IP address from the pop-up window.)<p>

The terminal/command window should be placed to the side of this browser
window so you can see both and easily go back and forth. You may have to
make the browser window somewhat narrower than usual.  Don't be
concerned about the X11 or other stuff showing after your login line and
above the command line where you will work.
(For those people who intend to use the HPC: The VCL image for this
tutorial is very similar to a login node in the HPC but you don't need
an HPC account. Also you don't interfere with HPC research usage while
you are experimenting and learning.)

</td></tr></table>

Remember that when you log out and delete an image reservation it it
totally gone. So if you mess up something and want to start with a fresh
image, just logout, delete the reservation and make a new one. That's a
nice feature of the VCE/VCL!<p>
