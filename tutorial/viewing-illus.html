An illustration of the results of entering 

<div class="codes">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>cat a</b></div>

where the file a was set up to have 3 lines in it, each with 3 copies of
"lots of characters".

<pre>
[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ cat a
lots of characters lots of characters lots of characters
lots of characters lots of characters lots of characters
lots of characters lots of characters lots of characters
[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ 
</pre>
If that works, but<br>
<div class="codes">[myid@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>cat nexample</b></div>
doesn't print anything - and it should print
what you had entered into the file nexample, then do<br>
<div class="codes">[myid@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>ls -l nexample</b></div>
and make sure it exists, and, if it does, that its size is not 0. If it
doesn't show up as a result of ls, or if its size is 0, then you won't
have anything printed. If that's so, then go back and use nano to write
out the nexample file as shown above.
