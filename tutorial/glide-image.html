<center><h3><font color=red>Setting up a Glide image/system </font></h3>
</center>

Why would you do this when it's available in the VCL?
<ul>
<li> Because you don't have access to the VCL.
<li> Because something is wrong and you can't get the Glide image in the
VCL
</ul>

So this is how to set it up anywhere, and then it can be used with the
Easy Glide into Linux tutorial. However, depending on how/where it's set
up, some of the instructions in the "Get Set Up" page may not be
appropriate.<p>

If you are the learner, you need to get help from a Linux user to get
this set up.<p>

The setup described here should work with all Linux distros. (The VCL
Glide image uses CentOS Release 7.9) But not all Linux systems have the
<b>tree command</b> installed, so add it via yum or apt, as appropiate, 
if it's not there. Everything else should be there. (We have found that
the tree command is very helpful for students to grasp the
tree-structure of computer directories.)<p>

The directory tree for the /home directory is
<pre>
/home
|-- hes
|   |-- a
|   |-- b
|   |-- c
|   |   |-- w
|   |   |-- y
|   |       |-- z
|   |-- first-cat
|   |-- first-file
|-- mtr
    |-- onlyonefile

4 directories, 7 files
</pre><p>

So the user's home directory (here it's hes) and also the subdirectories
c and y need to be set up. Also the /home/mtr directory.<p>

Then fill in the files - whose contents are:<br>

<pre>
$ cat a
lots of characters lots of characters lots of characters
lots of characters lots of characters lots of characters
lots of characters lots of characters lots of characters

$ cat b
This file doesn't have anything in it about bees.

$ cat w
123.45,546.7
32.1,458.904

$ cat z
This file is down in your directory tree. It's in a subdirectory of a
subdirectory of your own directory in /home

$ cat first-cat 
Muezza

$ cat first-file 
Is this the first file, or the second, or ...? Does anyone care?
Here's the second line of this file.
And the third.

$ cat onlyonefile 
which contains nothing
at all of interest
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> If you are using this page to set up a Linux system for use with
Glide, use the back arrow on the browser to get back to the start of the
Set Up page. The rest of this page is for illustrating working with
directories, and the Return link at the bottom will take you to the
Directory section of Glide.<p>

<audio controls> <source src="dir-tree2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> </audio>
<a href="transcript.html#dir-tree2">Transcript</a> 

<div class="codes">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>tree /home</b></div><p>

This should show you the 4 directories and 7 files as at the top of this
web page.<p>
