This introduction is intended to get you started as soon as possible. It
is divided into easy to handle chunks with alternating
audio discussions and command(s) shown. You should be logged into the
***** image in the VCL - that will be in a terminal/command window which
should be to the side of this browser window so you can see both and
easily go back and forth. The VCL image for this tutorial is very similar to
a login node in the HPC but you don't need an HPC account. Also you
don't interfere with research work going on in the HPC.<p>

After you've listened to an audio clip, type in the command (or cut and
paste) into the window, as directed, and check to make sure it works. <b>If
you don't execute the commands and think about the result you won't get
the full benefit.</b> Then play the next audio. Each section has a title and
is bounded by horizontal lines.<p>

Usually the audio will explain something and then tell you to go ahead
and execute the commmand(s). Sometimes rather than having audio, the text
will explain something briefly and then tell you to go ahead and execute
the command(s).<p>
