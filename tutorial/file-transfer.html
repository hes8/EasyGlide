File transfer can use the scp command in a Terminal Window on your Mac. This
software comes with OS X.<p>

You need to have a second terminal window open, in addition to the
terminal window accessing the remote VCL Linux system, as was the case in 
the previous exercises. This one is running on your Mac. (It's started
from Applications/Utilities.)<p>

You can transfer a file in either direction using the scp command, using
your local Terminal window, giving
the "from" file first and the "to" second. So to transfer a file to the
remote computer from your local home directory (indicated by the ~
symbol)<p>
<div class="codea">H:~ Henry$ <b>scp file-name myid@152.46.18.165:.
</b></div>
where 152.46.18.165 is the IP address of your Glide image reservation
and "file-name" is the name of your file on your local computer to be
copied to the remote computer. The "." after the ":" says
to keep the file-name the same. You will then receive a password
request from the remote computer - use the same password you used to
login. Use your window to the remote computer to see that the file was
received.<p>

Similarly the command<p>
<div class="codea">H:~ Henry$ <b>scp  myid@152.46.18.165:file-name .
</b></div>
transfers the remote file back into your local directory. Don't forget
the space after the file name, and then the following "." says it goes
into the directory in which you are working with the same name. As
before, you will get a password request.<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

WinSCP is a free software package for transferring files. Check if it
has already been installed on your local machine. If it hasn't,
it needs to be <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php"> downloaded 
to your local machine</a> - so you likely will need to have administrator 
privilege.<p>

To use WinSCP when you are have the Glide command window open via PuTTY, 
you need to start WinSCP. Use the File Protocol drop down menu to choose
SCP, and then login. You'll then have a window showing both your local
and remote directories. You can change directories by clicking on the
line showing the current directory or double clicking the (sub)directory
shown.<p> 
Then you just click and drag files from one computer to the other.
<b>But there is a small problem.</b> Windows and Linux use a slightly
different way to designate ending a line and starting a new line in a
text file ("text" includes numerical data). So if you move a data file
from Windows to the remote Linux computer, you'll need to convert the
file in the remote computer to use the Linux standard. That's very easy
using the dos2unix command.<sup>*</sup><p>
<div class="codea">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>dos2unix file-name</b></div>
dos2unix: converting file file-name to Unix format ...<p>

Now you're ready to use the data file on the remote Linux computer.<p>

To move text files from the remote Linux computer back to your local
Windows computer.<br>
First - convert to Windows<sup>*</sup> line endings via <p>

<div class="codea">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>unix2dos file-name</b></div>
unix2dos: converting file file-name to DOS format ...<p>

and then use WinSCP as above to click/drag the file to your Local
computer.<p>

<sup>*</sup>If you're curious about the use of "unix" vs "Linux" -
"unix" was the predecessor of Linux, and the name of this command
wasn't changed. Also the original Microsoft Operating System was called
"DOS" not Windows.

<div class="codea">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>sftp myid@152.46.18.165</b></div>

The sftp command is similar to scp, but is more efficient when more than
one or two file transfers are to be done. It is included in the MacOS
and in WinSCP - but read about the file format in the Windows section
above. When transfering several/many files, perhaps using multiple
directories - it certainly can be done with scp, but with a lot of
typing and multiples authentications. The sftp command only takes one
authentication (when you login to do the transfers), allows changing
directories and more. This <a
href="https://projects.ncsu.edu/hpc/Documents/CopyFiles.php">good short
writeup</a> covers the basics. Note: use your server IP address and
directories, not those given in the example. Also other software can
provide sftp capabilities, e.g. FileZilla.<p>

For <a href="https://projects.ncsu.edu/hpc/Documents/CopyFiles.php">a
lot more about transfering files</a> including larger scale techniques
(see Globus on that page for really large amounts of data.) But for most
learning by trying, probably including class assignments, the scp
transfer method described above should be adequate.
