<a name="set-up"></a>
Welcome to the Easy Glide into Linux. This is learning by doing. You
can't just sit there and read the material. You need to be active,
listen to the audio clip and then type in commands after finding out
what they do and then look at the results and consider the information
provided.<p>

You've gone through the Get Set Up page and now should have this web
page and the window to the remote Linux computer both visible on your
screen. A bit of overlap is ok, but you need to be able to read the
instructions on this page and see the remote computer window as you type
in commands and watch the results. Please don't cut and paste, this is
learning by doing and you will get more out of actually doing!<p>

This introduction is divided into easy to handle chunks with alternating
audio discussions and command(s) shown. After you've listened to an
audio clip, type in the command into the window, as directed, and check
to make sure it works. If you don't execute the commands and think about
the result you won't get the full benefit. Then play the next audio or
read the next text. Each section has a title and is bounded by
horizontal lines.<p>

<a name="entering"></a>
We'll be entering Linux commands, they are entered after the prompt.
Different varieties of Linux have somewhat different prompts. Usually
they have an indication of the directory you are in, we'll cover
directories later, and then end with a $ or a &gt; followed by a space
after which you enter a command. So the commands shown below are shown
coming after the prompt, and you have to press the Enter key after each
command to tell the computer to execute the command.<p>
<a href="index.html#entering">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="ls1"></a>
We'll start with the ls command which is short for list. Linux commands
are usually short because they have to be typed in. They are followed by
pressing the Enter key to tell the computer to execute them. So type in
and execute the command shown below.<p>
<a href="index.html#ls">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="ls2"></a>
What did you get? It should be a listing of what's in your directory,
your home directory. See that twiddle before the right bracket and the
dollar sign? It represents your home directory. Actually the real name
is tilde. When you're in a different directory, that directory name will
be in place of the twiddle. We'll discuss directories later. Now, to add
an option or argument to the command, type in the command below with the
option minus l. This stands for "long".<p>
<a href="index.html#ls">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="ls3"></a>
The output is the long format which shows permissions, ownership, file
size, date and file name. You should see a file named first-cat which has a size
of 7 bytes, which includes the content plus line endings. Look at the
third line in the listing, something named c and there is a d at the far
left of its line. That means c is the name of a directory, a
subdirectory of our home directory. The name c may be in a different
color to point out that it's not a file. Next, we can see what is in the
c directory by using its name after the ls command. So go ahead and
enter and execute the command immediately below.<p>

<a href="index.html#ls">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="nano1"></a>
Now that you've seen the files and directories which are already in your
home directory, it's time to create a new file. We'll use  nano  which
is one of many text editors. It is easy to start using it. Others are
more powerful, such as vim and emacs, but not as easy to start with.
After starting nano, the commands are at the bottom, and the caret means
to hold the Ctrl key while hitting the specified key. (It does not mean to 
use the caret character.) For example, Ctrl-X  will exit nano. If you know
another Linux text editor, feel free to use it, otherwise just use nano
in the exercises.<p>

There are two ways to make a new file. Either write the new file name
after the nano command and then press Enter. Or just start nano, and
then use Ctrl-O to write it out with the name you want.<p>

So now create a new file in your home directory, call it   nexample  .
Type in at least 15 lines, they can be short lines, but they should be
different, then save it and exit. Start with the command shown below.<p>
<a href="index.html#creating">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="nano2"></a>
List the files in your directory with the ls command and you'll see the
new file. What's in it? You can see its contents and also edit it by
opening it with the command shown below. So go ahead and open it, see
that it's what you wrote before and then edit it by adding one more line
and then save it by writing it out and then exit.<p>
<a href="index.html#creating">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="cat1"></a>
There are easier ways to just see the contents of a file and next we'll
look at a group of them. They are shown in the 4 lines immediately
below. Go ahead and execute all of them, and look at what each prints,
i.e. displays on the screen.<p>
<a href="index.html#viewing">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="cat2"></a>
cat simply prints on the screen the full contents of the file named
nexample. Less prints the full contents, but only a screen at a time.
head prints the top of the file, and tail prints the bottom of the file.
This should explain what you saw on your screen.<p>

However, cat has another very important use. It can join files. There's
a short file in your directory called a. You can see its contents by
using any of the display commands shown above. For example, execute the
command immediately below.<p>
<a href="index.html#viewing">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="cat3"></a>
Next cat is used to join two files. Execute the command immediately
below.<p>
<a href="index.html#viewing">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="cat4"></a>
That showed the results of joining the two files - and it can join more
than two by adding the file names to the command line. This can be
useful, and what's even more useful is being able to redirect the
results into a new file instead of it appearing on the screen. That is
shown in the command immediately below which you should execute.<p>
<a href="index.html#viewing">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="cp1"></a>
Another part of managing files has to do with copying them such as when
you want to make changes and also want to retain the original. To copy a
file we use the cp copy command, following it with the name of the file
to be copied and then the file name for the new copy. Try this using the
command immediately below, and then follow up with the next command to
see it is there and of the same size as the original file.<p>
<a href="index.html#copying">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="rm1"></a>
Removing files which are no longer wanted is another part of file
management. Remove the new copy you just made, using the command
immediately below and then follow up with the next command to see it's
gone.<p>
<a href="index.html#copying">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="mv1"></a>
The move command   mv   is similar to the copy command, but instead of
creating a new file, it moves it to a new name which simply changes its
name, or it moves it to a new directory. The commands immediately below
will make a new file as you did above, move it to a new name, and then
move it to a new directory and let you see the results.<p>
<a href="index.html#copying">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="scp1"></a>
The above commands are used in the remote computer. But when one wants
to copy files to/from local/remote computers, other software must be
used. For a local Mac, the software (scp or sftp) comes with the
Operating System. For a local Windows computer, open source software,
such as WinSCP and Filezilla, can be used. Because this involves
installation of software, no exercises are included here, but there is a
separate web page with instructions. While the interfaces are different,
the functionality is essentially that of the cp command.<p>
<a href="index.html#copying">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="man1"></a>
There are many options for most commands, too many to remember them all.
To refresh your memory there are Manuals at your finger tips which can
be viewed by using the man command. Each manual, referred to as a "man
page" gives a very terse summary of the purpose of the command, its
format and options and that's very useful. But there isn't much
explanation. For that the online tutorials do a better job. To see the
man page for the man command, execute the command immediately below. To
exit from a man page use the q key. Then execute the next command to see
the man page for a command you already know and see what the -l and -t
options do.<p>
<a href="index.html#man">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="pwd1"></a>
Earlier we said we'd come back to this topic, and the basic question is
"What directory am I working in?" The pwd command says to <b>p</b>rint the
<b>w</b>orking <b>d</b>irectory, the one in which you are working - 
and not just the
working directory name, but the full path starting from the root
directory. The root directory is symbolized by a forward slash / and is
the top level directory in your file system. When you execute the pwd
command, it will show the path from the root directory, followed by its
sub-directory named home and then to its sub-directory which has your
userid as its name. Now execute the command immediately below.<p>
<a href="index.html#pwd">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="cd1"></a>
To see what's in the /home directory, one way is to move into that
directory using the cd change directory command. Now execute the command
immediately below, and then the command below it.<p>
<a href="index.html#pwd">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="cd2"></a>
Since you're in a different directory, you can see that the twiddle in
the prompt has changed to home and ls shows all the users with
directories in the /home directory - including you.<p>

It would be good to get back to your own directory. There are a couple
of ways to do that. First one can explicitly write the full path name of
your directory after the cd command. But that takes some typing and the
cd command has a shortcut - just type the command with no file name
after it and it returns you to your own directory. Try than now.<p>
<a href="index.html#pwd">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="cd3"></a>
Another shortcut is that two periods in a row following a command refer
to the directory above the one you are in. Notice that there always is a
space after a command before anything else is typed in. So execute the
command below, and see where you go to, and then return to your own
directory using what you have learned above.<p>
<a href="index.html#pwd">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="mkdir1"></a>
While the commands above let you move around in directories, it would be
nice to make new directories and remove directories. The mkdir command
makes a new subdirectory in the directory you're in. Then you can copy
or move files into it, or make a new file in it using what you have
already learned. Make sure you are in your own directory and then make a
new directory using the command directly below and then see it exists
using the next command.<p>
<a href="index.html#pwd">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="rmdir1"></a>
A directory can be removed, but only when it is empty. So rather than
using your new directory, it can be removed since it's still empty.
Remove the new directory using the command directly below and then see
it is no longer there using the next command.<p>
<a href="index.html#pwd">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="ex1"></a>
It is good practice to logout or exit when you are done. At least one of
those two commands will work - often either will work. After you've
logged out, the connection will be terminated, you can close the window
in which you've been working and the (virtual) computer you've been
using will be made ready for another user.<p>
<a href="index.html#exiting">Return to tutorial.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="next1"></a>
If you're able to work all the exercises above, then you are ready to
work with a Linux computer. While there are many more commands, with
many of them very useful, you can wait until you need them. However what
you probably will need soon is the ability to transfer files back and
forth between your local computer and the remote Linux computer. That
allows you to put data into the remote computer, and then to retrieve
the result files to use them for presentations and publications. These
commands may require additional software, and you can reach a
description by clicking below.<p>

A tutorial on a few more useful commands and Linux functionality which
might be of interest can also be reached by clicking below.<p>

<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="transfer1"></a>
As mentioned before it is often necessary to transfer files in either
direction between your local computer and a remote Linux computer. There
are many ways to do this, and different ways have different advantages.
But we'll just look at one method which works very well for transferring
one or a few small files - by small I mean not too many megabytes.
There's one additional step for Windows users. It's not necessary for
Mac users if they are using OS X which you almost certainly are. Windows
users will need to make sure that the necessary file transfer software
is installed on the local computer.<p>
<a href="file-transfer.html">Return to File Transfer.</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="perm1"></a>
Linux was designed as a multi-user operating system, and so has a more
elaborate way of granting and restricting permissions than is typically
found or needed in an operating system designed for single-user
computers. Also Linux has some built-in protections, such as requiring
files to be given permission to be executable programs before they can
run as programs. We are just going to cover the most common uses which
you'll encounter when working in a Linux multi-user system in your own
account. We'll point out the permissions applicable for when you have a
group of collaborators.<p>

Every file and directory has a set of permissions specifying who can do
what with it. You've already seen the permissions listed in a hard to
understand way when using the  ls -l  command, and now we'll dig into
understanding them.<p>

We'll start with the viewing the permissions in your home directory in
your Glide reservation which is done with the ls -l command, so enter
that command from your home directory:<p>
<a href="perm.html">Return to Permissions</a>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;

<a name="perm2"></a>
You see the contents of your home directory and at the left are a series
of characters starting with a dash or the letter d. A dash indicates
it's a file, a d indicates it's a directory - and then 3 sets of
permissions, with 3 characters each, are shown after that. We'll deal
only with file permissions, and we'll deal only with the file
permissions in your directory. They are what you need to execute
programs in your directory, and dealing with groups and more gets more
complicated and you can learn that fairly easily once you're comfortable
with permissions in your own directory.<p>

Look at the parts of the lines you've displayed. If you have any
problems seeing them go back to the main Glide page and review the
section on Listing Directory Contents.<p>
<a href="perm.html">Return to Permissions.</a>

<a name="perm3"></a>
We want to make a file executable. To do this we first need to type in a
file which could be executed if it had the proper file permission. So
type the following two lines into a file named test.pl, make sure you
get every character correct as shown, and save the file. You can use the
nano editor which is shown on the main Glide page, or any other editor.<p>

You have changed the permissions to allow the test.pl in your directory
to be executed, you have seen the changed permissions and then seen that
test.pl could executed after changing its permission. That's the point
of this exercise.<p>

What about the other permissions - Group and World? We don't go into
them here because we've accomplished the aim of this section. We won't
go into group permissions because that involves setting up a group in a
shared computer. This is where 2 or more users are collaborating on a
project, and want to have shared access to one or more directories.
Setting up a group involves more Linux commands. However group and also
world permissions are similar to what you have seen, and you can learn
more about these topics in other tutorials, such as the recommended
ones.<p>

Here are a few more ways to get more done in Linux faster at the cost of
a bit more learning. Experienced users pick up many more methods,
commands and command options. You don't need the ones on this page to do
the Glide exercises, but they will be worth adding to your vocabulary as
you continue to use Linux. We'll start with the use of wildcards in file
names. Read the material below, and try out each command.<p>

The grep command searches inside files for a specified pattern. It can
be extremely useful even in simple ways, but to realize its full power
requires learning how to specify patterns via a notation called a
regular expression, or for short, a regex. Because of the complexity of
this area, we will only do some of the simpler examples. So execute the
command examples below.<p>

This next item deals with the pipe command which sends the output of one
command directly to the input of another command. So it's another
example of redirection of output. It can be extremely useful in
eliminating handling or storing of intermediate results. Below is an
example of a very simple task - run the exercise first without the pipe
and then the one with it. It's a very simple example and the benefit of
using the pipe can be much greater in more complicated tasks, but this
is a start.<p>

In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by the Easy Glide
into Linux, you'll need to have on your screen a window showing the
connection to the remote Linux computer which you'll be using. This web
page shows how to get this set up, and then, at the bottom of the page
there's a link to the learning material.<p>

It can help to actually see the arrangement of the sub-directories and
the files in them. The tree command shows these arranged in a tree-like
format starting with your directory which is shown as a dot. Now execute
the command immediately below which will show you all  your
subdirectories and files in them arranged in a tree diagram.<p>
