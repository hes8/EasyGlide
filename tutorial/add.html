<center><font color=red>Wildcards</font></center><p>

"Wildcards" in file and/or directory names allow display of selected
file or directory names rather than listing all of them.  * and ? are
the most commonly used ones. "*" represents 0 or more characters so <p>

<div class="codes">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>ls first*</b></div>
will display the names of all files and directories starting with the
letters "first" with 0 or more characters following in the name.<p>

"?" represents exactly one character. So<p>
<div class="codes">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ ls <b>first-c?t</b></div>
would display the file first-cat but not the file first-file. It would
also display first-cot, if there was such a file.

The grep command format is<p>

<b>grep pattern file(s)</b><p>

The pattern is a regular expression. The simplest one is just a
character string, and grep looks for a match in the file(s). It doesn't
have to be a complete word, just a string of characters. grep prints
the lines of file(s) matching a pattern (a regex).

<div class="codes">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>grep line first-file</b></div>

A regular expression example using a wildcard is sec.ond where the "." means
that any one character is considered a match for that position. The "*"
is commonly used to search many files, e.g. *html will include all the
html files in the directory.
(The notation differs between wildcards and regexes.)<p>
 
<div class="codes">[hes@vm16-203 ~]$ <b>grep se.ond first-file</b></div>

will look for 6 characters appearing anywhere in the file, where the
first 2 are specified as are the last 3, but the 3rd can be any
character. E.g. "se9ond" or "se+ond" appearing in the file would also
match.<p>

Regexes can be, and usually are, much more complicated than just using
wildcards. Learning to formulate all the types of regular expressions is
a more advanced topic, which can be very useful, and whole books have
been written on this topic. E.g. Mastering Regular Expressions by
Jeffrey Friedl.

The symbol for pipe is | <br>

A very simple task illustrating its use is to search two files for a
pattern. (It doesn't have to be in both files, and when it isn't,
nothing is output.) We could search them individually and "print" the
output of each command on the screen:<p>

<div class="codes">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>grep se.ond first-cat</b>
[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>grep se.ond first-file</b></div>

or put them together and do one search:

<div class="codes">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ cat <b>first-cat first-file > tmp-file</b>
[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>grep se.ond tmp-file</b>
[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>rm tmp-file</b></div>

where the last command removes the no longer needed temporary file,
and both approaches work, but using the | command makes it more straight
forward.<p>

<div class="codes">[hes@vm18-165 ~]$ <b>cat first-cat first-file | grep se.ond
</b></div>

will more directly arrive at the needed result. This is a very simple
example of using the pipe command to redirect the output of one command
directly into the input of another command.
